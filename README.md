# Star Lanes

This was a game that I used to play with my friends on an [Osborne
I](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_1) back in the 80s.

I'd had the MBASIC source floating around, but wanted to see if I could
find the original.

Some detective work later eventually led me to a Wikipedia article that
had the information I was after! For once, I should have started there.
